# Dashboard Description

An ongoing project creating a dashboard for a __"Superstore Sales"__ dataset, which contains data that provides insight into sales, customer behaviour and product performance. The `.pbix` file contains the most recent version of the report.

The original data can be accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=kaggle-dataset-share&utm_source=twitter ).

The dataset, initially a flat file, was converted to a data model with the following schema.
